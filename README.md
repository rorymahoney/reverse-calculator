# 🧮 The Reverse Calculator

> *The calculator that refuses to do the work for you.*

Most calculators solve problems for you. This one tests you. The **Reverse Calculator** is a web application built with vanilla web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) that flips the traditional calculator mechanics. Instead of pressing `=` to get the answer, pressing `=` tells you if the answer is right.

## 🌟 How It Works

The app operates in two distinct phases:

1. **Build Mode:** You use the keypad to type out a math problem (e.g., `8 * 7` or `15 + 24`). 
2. **Guess Mode:** Once you press the `=` button, the calculator calculates the real answer in the background, hides it, and prompts you with a `?`. You then type in what you think the answer is and press `=` again to see if you are correct!

## ✨ Features

* **Two-Stage Logic System:** Seamlessly switches between building an equation and accepting user guesses.
* **Modern UI:** Features a sleek, dark-mode aesthetic with interactive hover and active states for a satisfying tactile feel.
* **Error Handling:** Safely catches invalid math equations (like trailing operators) so the app won't crash.
* **Zero Dependencies:** 100% pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks or libraries required.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Since this project uses vanilla web technologies, getting it running locally is simple.
